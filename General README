To create a README file for your project, you'll want to include key sections that provide information about the project, how to set it up, and how to use it. Based on your description, here's a comprehensive README template tailored for a password management application built with Flask and Docker:

# Password Manager

A simple password management application built with Flask, Docker, and Docker Compose. This application allows you to add, retrieve, and list passwords securely.

2. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
3. [Setup](#setup)
4. [Usage](#usage)
5. [Docker Instructions](#docker-instructions)
6. [File Structure](#file-structure)

## Features

- Add passwords for various services
- Retrieve passwords for specific services
- List all stored passwords
- Secure storage of passwords using encryption

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Olisaemeka111/password-project.git
   cd password-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   If you prefer to set up the environment manually (not using Docker):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Create a `.env` file if necessary and ensure your environment variables are set up.

## Usage

1. **Run Locally**

   To run the Flask application locally:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   By default, it will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. **Endpoints**

   - `POST /add_password` - Add a password for a service
     - Form fields: `service`, `master_password`
   - `POST /get_password` - Retrieve a password for a service
     - Form fields: `service`, `master_password`
   - `POST /list_passwords` - List all stored passwords
     - Form field: `master_password`

## Docker Instructions

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker build -t my_flask_app .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 80:80 my_flask_app
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:80`.

3. **Using Docker Compose**

   If you have `docker-compose.yml`, you can build and run the container with:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will automatically build the image (if not already built) and run the container.

## File Structure

- `app.py` - The main Flask application file.
- `Dockerfile` - Dockerfile for creating the Docker image.
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration file.

- `templates/` - Directory containing HTML templates.
- `static/` - Directory containing static files like CSS, JS, images.
- `salt.txt` - File to store the salt for encryption.
- `passwords.enc` - Encrypted file to store passwords.
